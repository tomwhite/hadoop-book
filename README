The code is hosted at http://github.com/tomwhite/hadoop-book/. You can find code
for the first edition at http://github.com/tomwhite/hadoop-book/tree/1e, and
for the second edition at http://github.com/tomwhite/hadoop-book/tree/2e.

This version of the code has been tested with:
 * Hadoop 1.2.1/0.22.0/0.23.x/2.2.0
 * Avro 1.5.4
 * Pig 0.9.1
 * Hive 0.8.0
 * HBase 0.90.4/0.94.15
 * ZooKeeper 3.4.2
 * Sqoop 1.4.0-incubating
 * MRUnit 0.8.0-incubating

Before running the examples you need to install Hadoop, Pig, Hive, HBase,
ZooKeeper, and Sqoop (as appropriate) as explained in the book.

You also need to install Maven.

Then you can build the code with:

% mvn package -DskipTests

By default Hadoop 1.2.1 is used. This can be changed by specifying the
hadoop.version property, e.g.

% mvn package -DskipTests -Dhadoop.version=1.2.0

There are profiles for different Hadoop major versions and distributions,
specified in hadoop-meta/pom.xml, and they are specified using the hadoop.distro
property. For example, to use the default version of Hadoop 2:

% mvn package -DskipTests -Dhadoop.distro=apache-2

Again, you can specify hadoop.version to use a particular Hadoop 2 version:

% mvn package -DskipTests -Dhadoop.distro=apache-2 -Dhadoop.version=2.1.1-beta

You should then be able to run the examples from the book.
