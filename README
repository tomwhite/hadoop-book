This version of the code has been tested with Hadoop Core 0.20.0, Pig 0.2.0, 
HBase 0.20.0-dev (compiled from SVN trunk), and ZooKeeper 3.1.1.

Before running the examples you need to install Hadoop Core, Pig, HBase, and
ZooKeeper as explained in the book.

Then you can compile the code:

ant jar pig hbase

You should then be able to run the examples from the book.
