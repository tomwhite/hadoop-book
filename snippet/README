This directory contains tools for generating code snippets for the book and
testing that they are as expected.

Example invocations:

# First set the location of the Hadoop installation you are testing
# You need to have an unpacked copy of Hadoop in this directory
export HADOOP_HOME=~/dev/hadoop-1.0.0/

# From the top level
mvn verify -Phadoop.version=1.0.0

# From the snippet directory
mvn verify

# Run against a pseudo cluster (you need to start it first)
mvn verify -DargLine="-Dexample.mode=pseudo"

# Run the examples from chapter 2 only
mvn verify -DargLine="-Dexample.chapters=ch02-mr-intro"
